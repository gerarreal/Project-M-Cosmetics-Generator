# Project M Cosmetics Generator

Generates Character Selection Screen and Stage Selection Screen cosmetic names for Super Smash Bros. Brawl in the style of the original game, as well as in the style of Project M and it's successor, Project+.
Saved cosmetics are located in the directory it is launched.
  
  ## How to use:
  By booting up for the first time, the program will generate the necessary folders for the cosmetics and a .txt file containing the name of each playable fighter (char_list.txt) and stage (stage_list.txt) in Project+Ex.
  All characters are ordered in their respective Cosmetic IDs.
  
  The program only generates cosmetics if they aren't in their respective folders, so it won't overwrite on existing cosmetics, you must delete them first.
  
  Due to how the .txt file is structured, you can add more names in the list to generate character cosmetics.
  
  The program only reads stage_list.txt while it's running so you must change the filenames to work. If either file can't be found, it generates another.
  
  ## How to set up:
  IMPORTANT: The program only works on Windows.
  
  To set it up, extract all contents from the .zip to a folder.

NativeFS is used in the program to make cosmetics easier to find.
