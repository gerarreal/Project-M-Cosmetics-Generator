Generates CSS Cosmetics for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
Works for Project M and any character select screen that uses the same type of Character Select Screen icons as vanilla Brawl.
Saved cosmetics are located in <Username>\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Project M Cosmetics Generator
  
  ## How to use:
  By booting up for the first time, the program creates a directory in AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Project M Cosmetics
  Generator, along with 4 folders for the cosmetics and two .txt files containing the name of each playable
  fighter in Project+ (list.txt) and vanilla Brawl (list-vBrawl.txt). All characters are ordered in their
  respective Cosmetic IDs.
  
  The program only generates cosmetics if they aren't in their respective folders, so it won't overwrite on existing cosmetics, you must delete them first.
  
  Due to how the .txt file is structured, you can add more names in the list to generate character cosmetics.
  
  The program only reads list.txt while it's running so you must change the filenames to work. If either file can't be found, it generates another.
